# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Rachel and this is my GitHub for the data and code generated during my PhD in Translational Plant Sciences at The Ohio State University. In this repository you will find all supplementary data files cited in my dissertation, "The Physical and Molecular Responses of Pennycress (Thlaspi arvense L.) to Waterlogging".

If you would like access to my code for my RNA-seq analyses, please see my "Code-for-RNA-seq_Analysis" Repository.
